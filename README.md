# Ppr_hap_divergence

Steps followed to perform MDS analyses and explore evolutionary dynamics of the two diverging haplotypes (Alleles) in an asexually reproducing mite.

For MDS analyses, please check: [MDS](https://github.com/merrbii/Ppr_hap_divergence/blob/main/MDSing.md)
For overall as well as nucleotide diversity at synonymous/nonsynonymous sites, please check [here](https://github.com/merrbii/Ppr_hap_divergence/blob/main/calculateDiversity.md)
For calculating omega using hyphy, please check the [evolutionary rates pipeline](https://github.com/merrbii/Ppr_hap_divergence/blob/main/calculate_omega.md)
